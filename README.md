# Axerwan's Tactician Class
A module for Foundry VTT which includes support for the Tactician, a homebrew class for Pathfinder Second Edition made by me.

## Installation
In Foundry setup, click on the Install Module button and slap the following path in the Manifest URL!

<code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axerwans-tactician-class-pf2e/master/module.json</code>

## Usage
There is a total of 7 compendiums.

### Tactician Class
When you make a new character, you have to go in that compendium and drag the Tactician class onto the character sheet.

### Tactician Class Features, Equipment, Feats, Weapons
These should be turned on by default in the compendium browser (the magnifying glass on character sheets to look up equipment, feats, etc.).
If they're not, go in the compendium browser, click on the very last tab "Load Packs"
