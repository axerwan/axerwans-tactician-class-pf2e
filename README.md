# Axerwan's Tactician Class
A module for Foundry VTT which includes support for the Tactician, my homebrew class for the second edition of Pathfinder.

## Installation
In Foundry setup, click on the Install Module button and slap the following path in the Manifest URL!

<code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axerwans-tactician-class-pf2e/master/module.json</code>

## Usage
There is a total of 7 compendiums.

### Tactician Class
When you make a new character, you have to go in that compendium and drag the Tactician class onto the character sheet.

### Tactician Actions, Class Features, Equipment, Feats, Weapons
These should be turned on by default in the compendium browser (the magnifying glass on character sheets to look up equipment, feats, etc.).
If they're not, go in the compendium browser, click on the very last tab "Load Packs".

Make a single change then hit "Save Changes", and reload (not refresh) Foundry. When you come back, all Tactician packs should be enabled. 
Otherwise, you can also enable them one by one.

### Special Thanks
Thanks to MrVauxs, websterguy, nikolaj-a, Tikael, TMun, and stwlam for bearing with my lack of brain cells and answering to all of my questions.
Big thanks to MrVauxs for making the script which enables the compendium packs to be automatically loaded by Foundry.
