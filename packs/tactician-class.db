{"name":"Tactician","type":"class","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You are a talented diplomat, a master of calculus, or perhaps simply an open and understanding soul. Regardless, you are first and foremost a remarkable strategist, capable of analyzing the flow of a fight and maneuver its combatants into a position that's advantageous for you. Whether you're the ambusher or the ambushee, you can always come up with a plan that'll make you and your team emerge victorious.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE OR OTHER</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence or an option from paradigm.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<div class=\"rules d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h1>Key Terms</h1>\n<p>You'll see these key terms in many tactician class features.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Instruction:</strong> Abilities with this trait allow you to quickly advise a willing ally who you're aware of, unless mentioned otherwise. Instructions can either be vocal or a gesture. If you use a vocal instruction, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits. If you use a gesture, it gains the manipulate and visual traits. If an instruction affects multiple allies, you choose the bonus from your paradigm for each one. When you give an instruction to a creature already benefitting from one of your instructions, any ongoing effect from your previous one end immediately, including the bonus from your paradigm.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Gambit:</strong> Some of your actions can be made more efficient by bursts of insight: gambits. If an ability has a gambit entry, you can add the gambit trait to the action in order to use its enhanced effects, but attempt a DC 17 flat check after doing so. On a failure, you are unable to anticipate the flow of the fight any longer and can't use gambit actions. You can spend 10 minutes as an exploration activity to regain your focus, at which point you can use gambit actions again. Alternatively, when you score a critical hit with a Strike benefiting from Inextricable Strike, a new idea sparks in your mind and you can use gambit actions again.<br /><br />Contrarily to normal instructions, gambits are easier to understand and manage. The ongoing effects of an instruction with the gambit trait don't end for an ally when you give them a new instruction, nor do they end effects from a previous instruction. If an action can gain multiple gambit benefits, you only pick one.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Tactician</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You quickly and efficiently instruct your allies in order to bring out the best out of them, all the while analyzing your enemies to find and point out their weaknesses. Once things turn out the way you had predicted, your foes find themselves in a dangerous and inextricable situation that you can exploit.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You can be charming and understanding, like you can be blunt and cold as you provide knowledge about warfare.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You stay sharp, scouting ahead and looking out for traps and hidden dangers. You also study the terrain to figure out how it could work for - or against - you.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might craft various items, gather information, or work as an instructor. Eventually, your skills might make you famous, which could be a way to gain new allies.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To do</li>\n<li>To do</li>\n<li>To do</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To do</li>\n<li>To do</li>\n<li>To do</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.
